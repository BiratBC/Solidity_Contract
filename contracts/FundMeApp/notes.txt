Private key ||| > Public key > address

Private key generates public key

and Messages/transaction bind with your private key generates a signature using digital hashing method

Consensus : mechanism used to reach a state of agreement , majority matters , decide whether the transaction is valid or not or the current state is valid

chain selection 

bitcoin uses proof of work and longest chain rule-> longest chained block will be used
block confirmations -> upcomimng no of blocks after our transaction

sybil resistance -> proof of work and proof of stake

etherium 2 : proof of stake (shifted from poW)

bitcoin : proof of work

Proof of work : mining, computational actiivties , miners get the transaction fee,
nodes compete with each other to find the hash and the one who finds it are rewarded with block reward (time limited) and transaction fee

gas fee -> depends on how mmuch interation with blockchain
51% attack -> since MAJORITY is the key of blockchain if a miner (or attacker) adds block to the 'private' network, if takes control of 51% of network  

Proof of Stake : (collatral) Validators and Nominators , validators get the transaction fee
\validators : role of producing new blocks, validating parachain blocks, and guaranteeing finality.
- each node of the blockchain will have some stake on them and if they misbehave  or have shown malicious activities , they will loose all the stake of all nodes

sharding -> scalibility (when number of blocks are addded to the blockchain -> which can increase the amount of gas price) soln (blockvhain of blockchains) , used by layer 1 implementaion blockchain -> eth, btc
rollups-> same soln to scalibilty problem

deploymet costs the transaction fee and yellow buttons fucntions causes gas fee and transaction fee

smart contracts cannot directly get in contact with outer world like https request, api call, or existing payment systems but also smart contaract should not depend upon a single node
if thats the case it will loose its main feature of decentralization
